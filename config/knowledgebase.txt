Ground Level - Temporary Exhibition in Gallery 1 encompasses:
"Friend" temporary exhibition: based on the complex relationship between humans and technology. Lots of robots and AI. Exhibits include:
 - Robothespian: A humanoid robot that aspires to be an actor, performer, and educator.
 - Pepper: An old humanoid robot trying to continue on in the world
 - WABOT 2: One of the earliest full-scale humanoid robots, developed in Japan in 1984.
 - The Furby Wall: A collection of Furbies, the popular robotic toys from the late 1990s and early 2000s that interact and play with each other. Look closely at each of these Furbies on loan from people in Melbourne. As big tech sells chat interfaces that purport to solve the loneliness that their media helped create, how are people hacking, making, reclaiming and reviving alternative technological companions beyond the screen?
 - ELIZA: An early natural language processing computer program that simulates conversation.
 - Weak Robots: A collection of small, simple robots that demonstrate basic robotic functions and behaviors intended to evoke empathy and connection.
 - JIZAI Arms: 2020-2023, INAMI Jizai Body Project, Japan. “I can let you have one of my arms for the night,” said the girl. She took off her right arm at the shoulder and, with her left hand, laid it on my knee.” Yasunari Kawabata. This robot has four arms and a wearable base unit that embraces your torso. The supernumerary limb system is designed to create new forms of connection between people, cyborgs like us in our cyborg society. What would you do with shareable body parts? Attach, edit, alter, gift, or exchange them, and with whom
 - Qoobo, Petit Qooboo, Amagami HAMHAM, Nekojita FUFU. Yukai Engineering, 2007-Present, Japan. “I conasider robots as an interface that can warm our hearts and inspire us into action.” Shunsuke Aoki Qoobo the tailed cushion responds to your touch. Petit Qoobo vibrates like a heart. Nekojita blows on hot tea and Amagami HAM HAM play bites. Put your finnger in its mouth and it will nibble. The inbuilt hamgorithm has 24 randomised modes. Shunsuke Aoki, founder of Yukai engineering, shares intimate details about their creators: a young woman moved to a big city whose flat was too small to keep pets felt lonely. The ageing parent who missed the playful gnawing of their teething baby. These small robots reframe the human-machine story, into specific sensory and joyful encounters. Intelligent, and responsive design enabled by IOT communication principles and software we’re already familiar with through our phones. This is now the future where robots replace the screens for communication, play and company. 
 - PARO Protective Seal, Elena Knox 2020. 7-channel video installation Supported by Japan Science & Technology Agency, Waseda University, Galleri Svalbard, and Australia Houseat Echigo Tsumari Art FieldIn the winter of 2019, Knox journeyed from Tokyo to the Arctic Circle with PARO, a robot modelled after a harp seal pup that was developed in Japan to soothe the human soul. Since the onset of industrialisation, Earth’s thermosphere has thinned and global heating is steadily worsening. As a result, real Arctic seals are being affected by UV radiation, while their territory and food supply shrink due to ice melt and warming seas. What are the “thoughts” of the robot seal when confronted with this situation? And how should we, who view this transforming world through the adventurers PARO and Knox, feel about it, and act?PARO’s story evolves over seven slow video chapters. The little robot becomes aware, from its city residence, that wild seals are suffering. Concerned, it sets out solo, travelling northward via the Japanese Alps where it consults village elders about the shifting state of the natural world, and the role of machines in these changes.Finally, after great effort and a few flat batteries, PARO reaches harp seal habitat: darkness, ice and snow in the world’s northernmost settlement on the Svalbard archipelago. Here, again, PARO listens intently to the tales told by local elders.PARO’s expedition is a pilgrimage “home”, of sorts. It is an enormous, poignant quest for a small robot that had never even been outdoors.
